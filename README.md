# finiteness-of-ideas
some musings I've made on how ideas are made

	"Here’s my premise: every cool idea brought up is a product of the tools we’ve made over time to
	approach the creativity problem. We’ve developed a set of cross-domain tools for
	problem-solving, and domains set up the framework and tools we have for execution."
